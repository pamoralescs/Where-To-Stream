# **Where-To-Stream**

The **Where-To-Stream** app is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for movies and find where they are available for streaming. This project demonstrates modern web development practices, including responsive design, API integration, and robust error handling.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Movie Search**: Search for movies by title with a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Streaming Providers**: See a list of streaming platforms offering the movie.
- **Detailed Movie Info**: Includes the movie's poster, runtime, certification, release date, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices, styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Backend Proxy**: Secures API interactions through an Express backend.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly notifications for empty results, server delays, and other issues.
- **Server Wake-Up Notification**: Informs users when the backend server (hosted on Render) is waking up.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**:
  - React (TypeScript)
  - Vite for development and builds
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**:
  - Express.js (TypeScript)
  - Proxy for **TMDB API** interactions
- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - Backend: [Render](https://render.com)
- **API**:
  - [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for movie and streaming data

## **How to Run Locally**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js installed
- TMDB API key

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pamoralescs/where-to-stream.git
   cd where-to-stream
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create `.env` in the `server/` directory:
     ```
     TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
     PORT=3000
     ```
   - For the frontend, ensure the backend URL is set in Viteâ€™s `.env`:
     ```
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

4. Run the app:
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm run dev
     ```

5. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
